# おじさん図鑑 (Ojisan Zukan)

A humorous, Pokedex-style encyclopedia of middle-aged men phenotypes, generated by AI.

## Overview

"Ojisan Zukan" explores the fascinating ecosystem of middle-aged men ("Ojisan" in Japanese) with affection and humor. Every entry—including the text descriptions (in both Japanese and English) and the pencil-sketch-style illustrations—is procedurally generated using the [Google Gemini API](https://ai.google.dev/).

The project consists of a static frontend built with Vite and Vanilla JavaScript, paired with Node.js scripts for automated content generation. 

## Features

- **AI-Generated Content**: Uses `gemini-2.5-flash` for bilingual text generation and `gemini-2.0-flash-exp` for generating character illustrations.
- **Bilingual Interface**: Seamlessly toggle between Japanese and English text.
- **Static Site**: Fast and lightweight, deployed via GitHub Pages.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: HTML, Vanilla JavaScript, CSS, Vite
- **Backend/Scripts**: Node.js
- **AI Integration**: `@google/generative-ai`
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions (for automated content generation and deployment, scheduled weekly on Sundays)

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v20+ recommended)
- A Gemini API Key (if you want to generate new entries)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/ojisandex.git
   cd ojisandex
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

### Development

Start the local Vite development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open `http://localhost:5173` in your browser.

### Generating New Entries

To generate a new entry, you need a Gemini API key. Set it as an environment variable and run the generation script:

```bash
export GEMINI_API_KEY="your_api_key_here"
npm run generate
```

You can also provide a seed hint to control what kind of "Ojisan" gets generated:

```bash
GEMINI_API_KEY="your_api_key_here" node scripts/generate-entry.js --seed "IT業界にいるタイプ"
```
